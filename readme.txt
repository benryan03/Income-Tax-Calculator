This is a program that I wrote for practice with Python.

It asks the user to input the number of tax brackets to calculate, then the income limit and tax rate for each bracket, then the income to calculate taxes for.

Sample output:

Tax Bracket Calculator v1.6
Enter the number of brackets: 4
Enter the limit of bracket 1: 25000
Enter the tax rate of bracket 1 (period followed by number): .1
Enter the limit of bracket 2: 50000
Enter the tax rate of bracket 2 (period followed by number): .2
Enter the limit of bracket 3: 100000
Enter the tax rate of bracket 3 (period followed by number): .3
Enter the tax rate for income above 100000 (period followed by number): .4
Enter income: 78000
Net income: 62100.0
